## Authors

1. Matthew Crump, Brooklyn College of the City University of New York
2. Todd Gureckis, New York University

## Details

	Time: 8:30am - 11:20am

## Overview:

This workshop gives a practical introduction for running behavioral experiments online using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT). We demonstrate a variety of techniques for programming behavioral experiments in web browsers and for using the AMT system to collect data from the online population of AMT users. The workshop is novice friendly, and does not require advanced programming skills. We will 1) introduce basic JAVASCRIPT and HTML programming concepts, 2) give tutorials with working examples on applying those concepts to build a web-based experiment from scratch, and 3) introduce PsiTurk, an online platform for sharing online experiments and running them on AMT.

This workshop is cosponsored by APS and the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (SMEP).
